:computer: script searches graphic cards on a website and notified via messenger

Script parses [website](www.newegg.ca) (in my case it's newegg.ca) where finds div element with the necessary attribute. After that it creates a new list with links of graphic cards and goes through it. If any of card is in stock at the moment, script sends a message with it's link via [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) messenger
